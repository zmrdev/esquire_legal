            <h4>5. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ADR</h4>
            <article>
              Dispute resolution in India may be through courts, specialised
              tribunals (such as those for recovery of debt by banks or company
              disputes, among others), or alternative dispute resolution (ADR)
              mechanisms that include arbitration, mediation, and conciliation.
              The amendment to the Commercial Courts Act 2015 (Commercial Courts
              Act) provides for the constitution of commercial courts at a
              district level, except in areas where the High Court exercises
              ordinary civil jurisdiction and provides for commercial divisions
              (in all High Courts having ordinary civil jurisdiction) and
              commercial appellate divisions in each High Court for the
              adjudication and speedy disposal of commercial disputes of a
              specified value. Our dispute resolution lawyers are proactive,
              commercially oriented, and realistic, as well as technically
              proficient, with a forensic eye for detailing in assessing the
              merits. We recommend strategies for the early resolution of
              disputes, including by means of negotiation, mediation, and early
              neutral evaluation. Where it is not possible to resolve a dispute
              satisfactorily by agreement, we support in pursuing the
              proceedings, whether before the courts, a tribunal, or an
              arbitration panel, with efficiency and resolution. Prevention is
              better than cure, and a key part of our work involves assisting
              our clients with minimising the possibility of a dispute arising
              in the first place. For many reasons, including reduced cost,
              privacy, and efficiency ADR is often a better way to engage with
              your opponent than through risky and expensive litigation. We
              often encourage and suggest ADR mechanisms to our clients. ADR
              won't be appropriate in every case. But its flexibility, private
              nature, and cost-effectiveness aren't factors to be readily
              overlooked. Our lawyers are highly experienced legal practitioners
              representing clients in ADR processes, including acting as
              mediators and arbitrators. Part of our approach includes working
              closely with our clients to determine the best dispute resolution
              process to meet their needs – our clients have increasingly found
              that the privacy, flexibility, and relative speed of ADR make it a
              logical choice in business disputes of all kinds, including those
              featuring complex financial issues. We keep an open mind as to how
              we can best – and most cost-effectively – secure our clients’
              goals, advising them on the proper drafting of ADR provisions for
              both domestic and international transactions.

            <article>
              The Central Government has taken effective steps of codifying 29
              laws into 4 Codes so that workers can get the security along with
              respect, health, and other welfare measures with ease. The Labour
              Tribunal is proposed to institutionalize a vibrant mechanism for
              the speedy disposal of cases. To ensure security for all workers,
              the Central Government has amalgamated 9 Labour Laws into the
              Social Security Code in order to secure the right of workers to
              insurance, pension, gratuity, maternity benefit etc. Three Labour
              Laws have been amalgamated into the Industrial Relations Code for
              safeguarding the interests of Trade Unions as well as the workers
              so that there is minimal scope for disputes in the future.

            <article>
              Even well-run businesses and their directors can find themselves
              caught in an investigation as to wrongdoing where a financial
              offense may have been committed, whether arising out of financial
              losses, tax issues or dealings with authorities, or matters of
              international trade. We actively pursue matters relating to
              corporate fraud, bribery and corruption, insider dealing and

              record keeping, due diligence, corporate liability, immunity and
              leniency, and whistleblowing. If you or your business has been
              affected, you need legal advisers who are experienced in handling
              such matters with the ability to investigate, while all the time

              We act for and defend businesses and individuals of all shapes and
              sizes caught up in a wide range of domestic and international tax
              disputes and interactions with other tax authorities. An area of
              core expertise involves Direct Tax disputes, GST disputes,
              Investigations, and recovery of input tax, Customs. Our job is to
              challenge the Department when they seek to act, as they sometimes
              do, outside of their powers. Clients are drawn from almost every
              sector as no one is immune from the Department and taxes. We can
              step in at any stage from the initial enquiry letter issued by
              Department through to tax litigation and settlement with the
              Department. Many of our cases do settle which is almost invariably
              good news for any taxpayer. We offer the practical and legal
              skills needed to defend against the actions of the Department.
              Accountants find it helpful to entrust a case such as a Income tax
              and GST disputes to us, knowing that we evaluate the evidence from
              a legal standpoint and reach an early assessment as to the merits
              while being able to defend the proceedings robustly before the Tax
              Tribunal/ Department. We can guide you through the entire process,
              analysing where the concerned Department has misapplied the law
              and leveraging upwards from that point. We have many years’ of
              experience in resisting demands for taxes and penalties on behalf
              of businesses. The Departments have internal targets to meet for
              the amount of taxes, penalties, and interest that they recover. If
              the investigation is not handled properly, this could result in
              serious financial disadvantage, even bankruptcy, to you and your
              business.

              profits available on the goods. Another area of the dispute arises
              on the tariffs due on imports, particularly high-value goods. A

              regime, combined with knowledge of the latest practices, can put

              to the corporate when it has the right guidance to chose the right
